NAME
    JSAN::Mini - Creates a minimal local mirror of JSAN for offline
    installation

SYNOPSIS
      # Update your local minijsan using default settings
      JSAN::Mini->update_mirror;
      
  # ... and for now that's about it :)

DESCRIPTION
    minijsan is an application which scans the JSAN index and ensures that
    the release tarballs for all of the libraries in the index are stored in
    the local mirror provided by JSAN::Transport.

    This allows for the installation of JSAN packages without the need to
    connect to the internet. For example, it can be very useful for
    installing packaging while on international flights for example :)

    "JSAN::Mini" provides the primary API for implementing the functionality
    for minijsan, and also provides something that you can sub-class, and
    thus add your own additional functionality.

    If you're a normal user, or you are ot going to do anything weird, you
    might want to look at minijsan instead.

METHODS
  update_mirror
    The "update_mirror" static method creates and executes a new JSAN::Mini
    object using the default params, normally pretty much Doing What You
    Mean.

  new value => 'param'
    The "new" constructor creates a new minijsan process.

    It takes as argument a set of key/value pairs controlling it.

    verbose
        The verbose flag controls the level of debugging output that the
        object will produce.

        When set to true, it causes process information to be printed to
        "STDOUT". When set to false (the default) it prints nothing.

    Returns a "JSAN::Mini" object.

  added
    Once the "JSAN::Mini" object has been "run", the "added" method returns
    the number of new releases that were added to the local mirror.

  run
    The "run" method initiates the minicpan process to syncronize the files
    in the local mirror with those on the remote mirror.

    Returns the number of new files added to the minijsan mirror.

  add_release $release
    The "add_release" method is called when a release is to be added to the
    local mirror.

    The method is passed a JSAN::Index::Release object and, by default,
    mirrors it from the remote repository.

    This is the method that you would typically subclass to add additional
    functionality to the module (where such functionality does not on
    information contained) in other releases in the repository.

  process_release $release
    The optional "process_release" method can be defined by a "JSAN::Mini"
    sub-class, and can be used as a place to implement extended
    functionality, where this functionality requires that all new releases
    by downloaded before processing starts.

    The method is passed a JSAN::Index::Release object and simply shortcuts
    by default.
