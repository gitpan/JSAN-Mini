=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<minijsan> is an application for creating a minimal local mirror of only
the releases that might actually be needed to install the libraries in the
JSAN index (rather than mirroring all files in JSAN).

It currently implements only minimal functionality, and will only work
with L<JSAN::Client> based systems (which the main jsan shell isn't yet),
but does do what it is meant to.

=head1 SUPPORT
